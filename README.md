# A Survey on LLM-based Autonomous Agents

Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents are designed to accomplish specific objectives by self-guided instructions, automatic memorization, planning, and action. With the advent and prospering of large language models (LLMs), there is an expanding frontier in using LLMs as core controllers for these autonomous entities. However, a unified view that ties together the diverse studies in this field has been lacking. This repository houses a comprehensive and systematic survey that fills this gap, focusing on LLM-based autonomous AI agents in their construction, applications, and evaluation strategies.

In particular, we explore the essential components of an AI agent, including a profile module, a memory module, a planning module, and an action module. We further investigate the potential applications in natural and social sciences and introduce methods to evaluate their effectiveness. Challenges and future directions of this field are also discussed.

Our paper and this repository aim to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners alike, providing insights, related references, and continuous updates on this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
